**TASK**

```
Passing data between our Components.

By default properties are only accessible/bindable from within their
components and so that we can bind data from parent component A to child B

We must us the input decator that allows the property to be implicitly accessible
from other components.

@Input() element:{type:string,name:string,content:string}

element property in this case is now accessible to other components.And since its an object
it may be able to receive .

Input is what makes an elements component property bindable from outside of the component.

We may therefore as well bind to Components.
